//  Write a program that calculates and displays a person's body mass index (BMI). The
//  BMI is often used to determine whether a person is overweight or underweight for his
//  or her height. A person's BMI is calculated with the following formula:
//
//  BMI = weight * 703 / height^2
//
//  where weight is measured in pounds and height is measured in inches. The program should
//  display a message indicating whether the person has optimal weight, is underweight, or is
//  overweight. A person's weight is considered to be optimal if his or her BMI is between
//  18.5 and 25. If the BMI is less than 18.5, the person is considered to be underweight. If
//  the BMI value is greater than 25, the person is considered to be overweight.
